# Ana-oysters
In this presentation I took a dataset from Figshare on oyster larvae taken from different locations in Puget Sound that were then grown in the same environment. I created graphs to show the change in length and area for each of the populations over time.

My purpose now is to maybe try and use the two other data tables and also tidyr now that I deleted my site-specific graphs.

Below is the organization and contents of all the folders in my project.

## Packages Used
-ggplot2
-dplyr
-stringr
-tidyr

## scripts
-01-data-exploration.Rmd/html: not relevant to final project, just first assignment of reading in data and beginning to manipulate it
-01-pres-exploration.RMd/html: final presentation code

## raw_data
-Copy of PS_Larvae.csv: original data table of PS_Larvae data frame, includes information on the measurements of each oyster over time.
-Copy of Oyster Tile Size Data.csv: original data table of oyster_tile_size data frame, includes measurements scaled from the tile size
-Copy of Larval counts - Day 1-By Family.csv: original data table of larval_counts data frame, includes counts of population size and number of dead oysters at each time point for each population at each location

## output
-01-data-exploration.html/_files: copy of knitted presentation beginning, assignment from an earlier week 
-01-pres-exploration.html/_files: copy of knitted final presentation file

## images
-PS_larvae.jpg: image of part of the PS_Larvae data table from Figshare
-oyster_larvae_shape: image of oyster larvae to show their shape
