## The Experiment

The experiment data I'm using came from a paper called ["Consistent diferences in Fitness Traits across Multiple Generations of Olympia Oysters"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24455-3.pdf), listed as ["F2 Puget Sound Olympia Oyster Population Structure"](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/F2_Puget_Sound_Olympia_Oyster_Population_Structure/5975452?file=10717249) on Figshare. It was created by Katherine Silliman, Tynan Bowyer, and Steven Roberts.

## The Data
There are three relevant data tables from the experiment
-

## PS_Larvae Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
PS_larvae <- read.csv("../raw_data/Copy of PS_Larvae.csv") 
knitr::kable(PS_larvae)
```
