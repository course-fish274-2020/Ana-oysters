## The Experiment

The experiment data I'm using came from a paper called ["Consistent diferences in Fitness Traits across Multiple Generations of Olympia Oysters"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24455-3.pdf), listed as ["F2 Puget Sound Olympia Oyster Population Structure"](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/F2_Puget_Sound_Olympia_Oyster_Population_Structure/5975452?file=10717249) on Figshare. It was created by Katherine Silliman, Tynan Bowyer, and Steven Roberts.

## The Data
There are three relevant data tables from the experiment
-PS_larvae: includes lengths and areas for each oyster at three time points
-oyster_tile_size: 
-larval_counts: includes counts of population size and number of dead oysters at each time point for each population at each location

## PS_Larvae Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
PS_larvae <- read.csv("../raw_data/Copy of PS_Larvae.csv") 

```
![PS_larvae data table from Figshare]("../images/PS_larvae.jpg")

## Average Shell Length over Time in 3 Populations

```{r, message = FALSE}
popul_days <- group_by(PS_larvae, Population, Date)
#average length for each population
avg_l_popul <- summarize(popul_days, mean_l = mean(Average_Length), na.rm = TRUE)
#added column for days after start
avg_l_popul$Days = c(0, 14, 7, 0, 14, 7, 0, 14, 7)
#scatterplot of days passed vs length for each population with a line of best fit for each population
daysvslength <- ggplot(data = avg_l_popul, mapping = aes(x = Days, y = mean_l, group = Population)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = Population, color = Population, size = 3)) +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Average Shell Length (mm)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c (0, 7, 14)) +
  ggtitle("Shell Length over Time by Population")
print(daysvslength)
```


#change data table replicate and show for each population at each location
